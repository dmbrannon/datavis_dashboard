# COVID-19 Apple Mobility Data Visualization Dashboard
> Dana M. Brannon, The University of Texas at Austin

For my final project for CS 329E Elements of Data Visualization, I wanted to analyze and visualize Apple's COVID-19 mobility data to see how the pandemic has affected the movement of people and goods. The most updated version of the dataset can be found [here](https://www.apple.com/covid19/mobility).

```
git clone https://github.com/dmbrannon/datavis_dashboard.git
cd datavis_dashboard
jupyter notebook
```
